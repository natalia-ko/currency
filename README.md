-move the resulting package ‘currency-master’ to anywhere you can use gradle

-open terminal/CL and change directory to the package ‘currency-master’

-use command: ./gradlew bootRun

-wait until application starts

-go to http://localhost:8080/EUR
(you can use any currency of this list https://docs.openexchangerates.org/docs/supported-currencies, just check it is three-capital-letter code)
